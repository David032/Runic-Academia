This was originally my masters dissertation project, where I built a system to assess a player's actions, analyse them in order to establish what they may be doing and then adjust the game world based on those predictions. It also incorporates my bachelors dissertation project, which allows for more advanced non-player characters but doesn't fully utilise it in this context at present.

Basically it watches how the player plays in a hub town & dungeon and adjusts the dungeon's difficulty/size/complexity/etc.

**The actually interesting code can be found in Assets/Cardinal, which'll open a GitHub Repo as it's a submodule for resuability.**
