**The actually interesting code can be found in Assets/Cardinal, which'll open a GitHub Repo as it's a submodule for resuability.**

This was originally my masters dissertation project, where I built a system to assess a player's actions, analyse them in order to establish what they may be doing and then adjust the game world based on those predictions. It also incorporates my bachelors dissertation project, which allows for more advanced non-player characters but doesn't fully utilise it in this context at present.

The project is built around a hub town & demo dungeon  for the player to interact/trade with(in the hub area) and explore/overcome/defeat enemies(in the dungeon). And the system adjusts the dungeon's difficulty/size/complexity/etc based on what it believes the player's goals are based on their current actions, in game state, etc.

The project uses unity 2021.3.
